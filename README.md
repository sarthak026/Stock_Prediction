# Stock_Prediction
 This LSTM-based Stock Price Prediction Model leverages deep learning to analyze historical stock data, capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.
The model's strength lies in its ability to learn and adapt to various features, such as trading volume, technical indicators, and macroeconomic factors. Through an iterative training process, the LSTM network refines its parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual stock prices. This ensures a dynamic understanding of market behavior and enhances predictive accuracy over time.

Upon training completion, the LSTM model serves as a powerful tool for generating future stock price predictions. By considering historical context and learned patterns, it empowers investors and traders with valuable insights to make informed decisions. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the unpredictable nature of the stock market and understand that while the model provides useful forecasts, absolute accuracy cannot be guaranteed.


 Project Components:
Structured into key sections, the project covers data collection through the Yahoo Finance API, exploratory data analysis, visualization using matplotlib and seaborn, calculation of moving averages and technical indicators, risk assessment, and stock price prediction using LSTM. Each section contributes to a comprehensive understanding of stock behavior.

Running the Code:
To replicate the analysis and run the LSTM model, users can follow the provided steps, including installing dependencies and executing Jupyter notebooks in sequential order.

Key Questions Addressed:
The project addresses critical questions such as changes in stock price over time, daily stock return averages, moving averages of various stocks, correlation between different stocks, risk assessment through volatility metrics, and attempts to predict future stock behavior.

Conclusion:
The Stock Analysis and Prediction project aims to equip users with insights into historical stock trends, risk assessment strategies, and potential future price predictions. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, investors can make more informed decisions in the dynamic realm of financial markets.
