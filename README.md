# Stock_Prediction
 This LSTM-based Stock Price Prediction Model leverages deep learning to analyze historical stock data, capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.
The model's strength lies in its ability to learn and adapt to various features, such as trading volume, technical indicators, and macroeconomic factors. Through an iterative training process, the LSTM network refines its parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual stock prices. This ensures a dynamic understanding of market behavior and enhances predictive accuracy over time.

Upon training completion, the LSTM model serves as a powerful tool for generating future stock price predictions. By considering historical context and learned patterns, it empowers investors and traders with valuable insights to make informed decisions. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the unpredictable nature of the stock market and understand that while the model provides useful forecasts, absolute accuracy cannot be guaranteed.
